## 🔑 Key Features

- 🧠 **Planner–Executor Framework** – Separates large-scale, code-driven search from high-level reasoning for cleaner context and deeper thinking.  
- 📜 **Code-Based Search Primitives** – Execute `batch_search`, `check_condition`, `generate_keywords` operations over thousands of pages with minimal context overhead.  
- 🎯 **Confidence-Guided Replanning** – Dynamically reset strategy when confidence is low to avoid premature convergence.
