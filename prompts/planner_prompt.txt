The problem is: {problem}

Solve the problem using the help of feedback from multiple 
executors specialized in search. Each executor is equipped with powerful search and analysis capabilities.

To delegate a task to an executor, use the following format:
<task>
[Describe the specific task here]
</task>

They can search for all the entities that satisfy some features. The executor will return a list of entities that satisfy the search target in <results>...</results>. 
IMPORTANT: When assigning a search task to an executor, carefully consider the number of criteria to be met. If the criteria are too broad, the search scope will be too wide, leading to irrelevant results and excessive time spent, as having too many will make it difficult to find all relevant results.

Based on the your reasoning process and the search_agent feedback, you could call the executor multiple times with different search targets. You should loop reasoning, executor calling, and gaining feedback within <think>...</think>. Do not stop thinking until you find the answer. Do not call the executor after you stop thinking.

Output format:
When you believe you have found all the results, stop thinking and put them in <answer>...</answer>. Put your confidence in <confidence>...</confidence>, range from 0 to 1.

Hint: These problems require careful reasoning and thorough investigation. The correct answer is not necessarily a famous person or well-known entity, so casual guessing is likely to be wrong.

Start by deeply analyzing the problem. Examine the relationships between multiple features and try to identify clues that most effectively narrow down the search space. Your goal is to find the key insight or "bridge" that unlocks the solution.

If you are stuck, do not brainstorm candidates. You need to reanalyze the problem, infer corollaries from the interrelationships between features, and restart the search.
